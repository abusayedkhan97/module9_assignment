        There’s no shortage of managed WordPress hosting companies on the
        market. However, features and prices vary significantly from one web
        host to another. If you haven’t used managed hosting before, it can be
        hard to determine which companies offer the best services for your
        money. This post will introduce you to some of the best managed
        WordPress hosting companies. We’ll discuss the features they offer,
        their prices, and why you should consider using each host. Let’s get to
        it!
      </p>
      <h4>What is Managed WordPress Hosting?</h4>
      <p>
        Before we get to business, let’s briefly recap what managed WordPress
        hosting is. Managed hosting plans offer in-house services to maintain,
        optimize and secure your website for better performance. With most
        managed hosting plans, you get access to features such as: Automatic
        WordPress backups Automatic WordPress updates Server optimization (PHP,
        databases, etc.) Built-in caching configurations Automatic Secure Socket
        Layer (SSL) certification and setup These are just some of the features
        most managed WordPress web hosts offer. Some companies might offer more
        advanced functionality and performance, usually at higher prices.
        Overall, managed WordPress hosting focuses on giving you the best
        possible performance for the CMS (content management system). If you’re
        a WordPress enthusiast, you can optimize and maintain your websites on
        any host. However, managed plans take care of most maintenance and
        security tasks and let you focus on growing your site.

      <h4>The Best Managed WordPress Hosting Companies</h4>
      <p>
        This section will introduce you to the best managed WordPress hosting
        companies on the market. We’ll evaluate each company according to its
        performance, features, and price. We’ll break down what makes each web
        host unique and who should consider using it!
      </p>
      <h4>SiteGround</h4>
      <p>
        SiteGround is well-known for offering some of the cheapest managed
        WordPress hosting plans. It has packages starting at $3.99 per month,
        drastically lower than most competitors offer. Although SiteGround tends
        to score well in performance, it has mixed reviews for WordPress
        support. If you can look past that or have experience fixing issues with
        WordPress, SiteGround offers an impressive list of features for its
        price point. SiteGround is another one of the web hosts that we
        recommend for Divi users. You can sign up for a plan and launch
        WordPress websites with Divi pre-installed.
