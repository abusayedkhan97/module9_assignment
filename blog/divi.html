        Are you running out of creative ideas for your website headers? Or are
        you looking for a pack of header layouts to save you time and effort for
        your next design project? Divi Headers Pack is a Divi Marketplace
        product with 960+ header layouts for the Divi Builder. Each header
        design is mobile-friendly and comes with many varieties for you to
        choose from. And because it’s built with Divi, it’s all completely
        customizable within the Divi Builder. In this product highlight, we’ll
        look at some of the layouts you get with the Divi Headers Pack to help
        you decide if it’s the right product for you.

        Many of the header layouts have multiple variations with different
        effects, functionality, and styling. Additionally, many of the header
        layouts come with three versions – one with a mobile menu that slides in
        from the left, one that slides in from the right, and one with a
        full-screen mobile menu. With all of the variations, there are a total
        of 980+ header layouts that come with the Divi Headers Pack.
